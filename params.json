I was learning iOS (mainly Object-C) and decided to develop a new weibo.com client. After first release, I realized that I don't have the time and efforts to maintain it myself. So I open sourced it here.\r\n\r\n### Design Principal\r\nThe UI/UX design is mostly borrowed from [echofon](http://www.echofon.com/twitter/mac/) for its simplicity, which is my favorite style. The first release is in fact a replica. This is why I am not satisfied so I re-designed it.\r\n\r\n### Make Contributions\r\nIt is highly appreciated if you can send some pull requests to make it better. Currently, only the backend is working. \r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nwuyb.com","google":"","tagline":"weibo.com macos x client"}
