boboa
=====
boboa  (http://t.wuyb.com) is a Sina Weibo (http://weibo.com) client on MacOS X(10.6+). The working version can be downloaded from the homepage, which has different code base, sadly, a very bad one.

It is open sourced so that people who are interested in Cocoa development and Weibo can help me to improve the quality of both the software and code.

The Plan
========
I plan to open source the software piece by piece. 

1. The module to talk with Weibo.com server. (done)
2. The user information management module.
3. The basic UI including displaying the statuses, user comments and reposts.
4. Other stuff.
